    description: `Enables quick setup and easy management of state in React applications. Provides an inbuilt Errors store and Pending store (stores being blocks of state) which interact with the stores you create.`,
    detail: `This is a state management tool built on top of Reacts Context API.  
    When using Context or Redux the actions in our stores often require asynchronous API requests. 
    It is helpful to know when these actions are pending and when they have resolved or failed. 
    SCS provides an inbuilt pending store and errors store and wraps all asynchronous actions with 
    a pending and errors state. SCS exposes one provider and three hooks so you can quickly set up your 
    stores and access state and actions in your components.`,
